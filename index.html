              John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. | John 1:2 He was with God in the beginning. | John 1:3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. | John 1:4 In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. | John 1:5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. | John 1:6 There was a man sent from God whose name was John. | John 1:7 He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. | John 1:8 He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. | John 1:9 The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. | John 1:10 He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. | John 1:11 He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. | John 1:12 Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— | John 1:13 children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. | John 1:14 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. | John 1:15 John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, “This is the one I spoke about when I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’” | John 1:16 Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given. | John 1:17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. | John 1:18 No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known. | John 1:19 Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. | John 1:20 He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not the Messiah.” | John 1:21 They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No.” | John 1:22 Finally they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” | John 1:23 John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, “I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’” | John 1:24 Now the Pharisees who had been sent | John 1:25 questioned him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” | John 1:26 “I baptize with water,” John replied, “but among you stands one you do not know. | John 1:27 He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.” | John 1:28 This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. | John 1:29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! | John 1:30 This is the one I meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’ | John 1:31 I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.” | John 1:32 Then John gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. | John 1:33 And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ | John 1:34 I have seen and I testify that this is God’s Chosen One.” | John 1:35 The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. | John 1:36 When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” | John 1:37 When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. | John 1:38 Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, “What do you want?” They said, “Rabbi” (which means “Teacher”), “where are you staying?” | John 1:39 “Come,” he replied, “and you will see.” So they went and saw where he was staying, and they spent that day with him. It was about four in the afternoon. | John 1:40 Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. | John 1:41 The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “We have found the Messiah” (that is, the Christ). | John 1:42 And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which, when translated, is Peter). | John 1:43 The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, “Follow me.” | John 1:44 Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. | John 1:45 Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” | John 1:46 “Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?” Nathanael asked. “Come and see,” said Philip. | John 1:47 When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, “Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.” | John 1:48 “How do you know me?” Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, “I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.” | John 1:49 Then Nathanael declared, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.” | John 1:50 Jesus said, “You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that.” | John 1:51 He then added, “Very truly I tell you, you will see ‘heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on’ the Son of Man.| John 2:1 On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, | John 2:2 and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. | John 2:3 When the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.” | John 2:4 “Woman, why do you involve me?” Jesus replied. “My hour has not yet come.” | John 2:5 His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” | John 2:6 Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons. | John 2:7 Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water”; so they filled them to the brim. | John 2:8 Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.” They did so, | John 2:9 and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside | John 2:10 and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.” | John 2:11 What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. | John 2:12 After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days. | John 2:13 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. | John 2:14 In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money. | John 2:15 So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. | John 2:16 To those who sold doves he said, “Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father’s house into a market!” | John 2:17 His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for your house will consume me.” | John 2:18 The Jews then responded to him, “What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?” | John 2:19 Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.” | John 2:20 They replied, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?” | John 2:21 But the temple he had spoken of was his body. | John 2:22 After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken. | John 2:23 Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name. | John 2:24 But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people. | John 2:25 He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person. | John 3:1 Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. | John 3:2 He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.” | John 3:3 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.” | John 3:4 “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!” | John 3:5 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. | John 3:6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. | John 3:7 You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again.’ | John 3:8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.” | John 3:9 “How can this be?” Nicodemus asked. | John 3:10 “You are Israel’s teacher,” said Jesus, “and do you not understand these things? | John 3:11 Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. | John 3:12 I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? | John 3:13 No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man. | John 3:14 Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, | John 3:15 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him. | John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. | John 3:17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. | John 3:18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. | John 3:19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. | John 3:20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. | John 3:21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God. | John 3:22 After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. | John 3:23 Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized. | John 3:24 This was before John was put in prison. | John 3:25 An argument developed between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. | John 3:26 They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan—the one you testified about—look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.” | John 3:27 To this John replied, “A person can receive only what is given them from heaven. | John 3:28 You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.’ | John 3:29 The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. | John 3:30 He must become greater; I must become less.” | John 3:31 The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. | John 3:32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. | John 3:33 Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. | John 3:34 For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. | John 3:35 The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. | John 3:36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them.|
              John 4:1 Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John— | John 4:2 although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples. | John 4:3 So he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee. | John 4:4 Now he had to go through Samaria. | John 4:5 So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. | John 4:6 Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon. | John 4:7 When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Will you give me a drink?” | John 4:8 (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) | John 4:9 The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.) | John 4:10 Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.” | John 4:11 “Sir,” the woman said, “you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? | John 4:12 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?” | John 4:13 Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, | John 4:14 but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” | John 4:15 The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I won’t get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.” | John 4:16 He told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.” | John 4:17 “I have no husband,” she replied. Jesus said to her, “You are right when you say you have no husband. | John 4:18 The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.” | John 4:19 “Sir,” the woman said, “I can see that you are a prophet. | John 4:20 Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.” | John 4:21 “Woman,” Jesus replied, “believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. | John 4:22 You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. | John 4:23 Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. | John 4:24 God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.” | John 4:25 The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.” | John 4:26 Then Jesus declared, “I, the one speaking to you—I am he.” | John 4:27 Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?” | John 4:28 Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, | John 4:29 “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?” | John 4:30 They came out of the town and made their way toward him. | John 4:31 Meanwhile his disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat something.” | John 4:32 But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” | John 4:33 Then his disciples said to each other, “Could someone have brought him food?” | John 4:34 “My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. | John 4:35 Don’t you have a saying, ‘It’s still four months until harvest’? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. | John 4:36 Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. | John 4:37 Thus the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true. | John 4:38 I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.” | John 4:39 Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.” | John 4:40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. | John 4:41 And because of his words many more became believers. | John 4:42 They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.” | John 4:43 After the two days he left for Galilee. | John 4:44 (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) | John 4:45 When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there. | John 4:46 Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. | John 4:47 When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death. | John 4:48 “Unless you people see signs and wonders,” Jesus told him, “you will never believe.” | John 4:49 The royal official said, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” | John 4:50 “Go,” Jesus replied, “your son will live.” The man took Jesus at his word and departed. | John 4:51 While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. | John 4:52 When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, “Yesterday, at one in the afternoon, the fever left him.” | John 4:53 Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” So he and his whole household believed. | John 4:54 This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.|
              John 5:1 Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals. | John 5:2 Now there is in Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. | John 5:3 Here a great number of disabled people used to lie—the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. | John 5:4 [Note: Some early manuscripts include here: "from time to time an angel of the Lord would come down and stir up the water. The first one to enter the pool after each such disturbance would be cured of whatever disease they had."] | John 5:5 One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. | John 5:6 When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to get well?” | John 5:7 “Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.” | John 5:8 Then Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.” | John 5:9 At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, | John 5:10 and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.” | John 5:11 But he replied, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’” | John 5:12 So they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?” | John 5:13 The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there. | John 5:14 Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.” | John 5:15 The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well. | John 5:16 So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him. | John 5:17 Jesus said to them, “My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.” | John 5:18 For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. | John 5:19 Jesus gave them this answer: “Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. | John 5:20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed. | John 5:21 For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. | John 5:22 Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, | John 5:23 that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him. | John 5:24 Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life. | John 5:25 Very truly I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. | John 5:26 For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. | John 5:27 And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man. | John 5:28 Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice | John 5:29 and come out—those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned. | John 5:30 By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me. | John 5:31 If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. | John 5:32 There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true. | John 5:33 You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. | John 5:34 Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved. | John 5:35 John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light. | John 5:36 I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to finish—the very works that I am doing—testify that the Father has sent me. | John 5:37 And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, | John 5:38 nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent. | John 5:39 You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, | John 5:40 yet you refuse to come to me to have life. | John 5:41 I do not accept glory from human beings, | John 5:42 but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts. | John 5:43 I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him. | John 5:44 How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? | John 5:45 But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. | John 5:46 If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. | John 5:47 But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?|
              John 6:1 Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias), | John 6:2 and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the signs he had performed by healing the sick. | John 6:3 Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. | John 6:4 The Jewish Passover Festival was near. | John 6:5 When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, “Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?” | John 6:6 He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do. | John 6:7 Philip answered him, “It would take more than half a year’s wages to buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!” | John 6:8 Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up, | John 6:9 “Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?” | John 6:10 Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” There was plenty of grass in that place, and they sat down (about five thousand men were there). | John 6:11 Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish. | John 6:12 When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, “Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.” | John 6:13 So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. | John 6:14 After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, “Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.” | John 6:15 Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. | John 6:16 When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, | John 6:17 where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. | John 6:18 A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. | John 6:19 When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were frightened. | John 6:20 But he said to them, “It is I; don’t be afraid.” | John 6:21 Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. | John 6:22 The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. | John 6:23 Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. | John 6:24 Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus. | John 6:25 When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” | John 6:26 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. | John 6:27 Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.” | John 6:28 Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” | John 6:29 Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.” | John 6:30 So they asked him, “What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? | John 6:31 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” | John 6:32 Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. | John 6:33 For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” | John 6:34 “Sir,” they said, “always give us this bread.” | John 6:35 Then Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. | John 6:36 But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. | John 6:37 All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. | John 6:38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. | John 6:39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. | John 6:40 For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.” | John 6:41 At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” | John 6:42 They said, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, ‘I came down from heaven’?” | John 6:43 “Stop grumbling among yourselves,” Jesus answered. | John 6:44 “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day. | John 6:45 It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me. | John 6:46 No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. | John 6:47 Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life. | John 6:48 I am the bread of life. | John 6:49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. | John 6:50 But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. | John 6:51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.” | John 6:52 Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” | John 6:53 Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. | John 6:54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. | John 6:55 For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. | John 6:56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. | John 6:57 Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. | John 6:58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.” | John 6:59 He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. | John 6:60 On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?” | John 6:61 Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, “Does this offend you? | John 6:62 Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! | John 6:63 The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life. |
              John 6:64 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. | John 6:65 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. | John 6:66 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. | John 6:67 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? | John 6:68 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. | John 6:69 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. | John 6:70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? | John 6:71 He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.|
              John 7:1 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. | John 7:2 Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand. | John 7:3 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. | John 7:4 For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. | John 7:5 For neither did his brethren believe in him. | John 7:6 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. | John 7:7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. | John 7:8 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come. | John 7:9 When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee. | John 7:10 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. | John 7:11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? | John 7:12 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. | John 7:13 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. | John 7:14 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. | John 7:15 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? | John 7:16 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. | John 7:17 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. | John 7:18 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. | John 7:19 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? | John 7:20 The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? | John 7:21 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. | John 7:22 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. | John 7:23 If a man on the sabbath day receives circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? | John 7:24 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. | John 7:25 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? | John 7:26 But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? | John 7:27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. | John 7:28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. | John 7:29 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. | John 7:30 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. | John 7:31 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? | John 7:32 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. | John 7:33 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. | John 7:34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come. | John 7:35 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? | John 7:36 What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come? | John 7:37 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. | John 7:38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. | John 7:39 But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified. | John 7:40 Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. | John 7:41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? | John 7:42 Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? | John 7:43 So there was a division among the people because of him. | John 7:44 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. | John 7:45 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? | John 7:46 The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. | John 7:47 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? | John 7:48 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? | John 7:49 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. | John 7:50 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) | John 7:51 Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth? | John 7:52 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. | John 7:53 And every man went unto his own house.|
              John 8:1 Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. | John 8:2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. | John 8:3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, | John 8:4 They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. | John 8:5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? | John 8:6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. | John 8:7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. | John 8:8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. | John 8:9 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. | John 8:10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? | John 8:11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. | John 8:12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. | John 8:13 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. | John 8:14 Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. | John 8:15 Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. | John 8:16 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. | John 8:17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. | John 8:18 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. | John 8:19 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. | John 8:20 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. | John 8:21 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. | John 8:22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. | John 8:23 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. | John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. | John 8:25 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. | John 8:26 I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. | John 8:27 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. | John 8:28 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. | John 8:29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. | John 8:30 As he spake these words, many believed on him. | John 8:31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; | John 8:32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. | John 8:33 They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? | John 8:34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. | John 8:35 And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. | John 8:36 If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. | John 8:37 I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. | John 8:38 I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. | John 8:39 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. | John 8:40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. | John 8:41 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. | John 8:42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. | John 8:43 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. | John 8:44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. | John 8:45 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. | John 8:46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? | John 8:47 He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. | John 8:48 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? | John 8:49 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. | John 8:50 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. | John 8:51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. | John 8:52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. | John 8:53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? | John 8:54 Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: | John 8:55 Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying. | John 8:56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad. | John 8:57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? | John 8:58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. | John 8:59 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.|
              John 9:1 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. | John 9:2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? | John 9:3 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. | John 9:4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. | John 9:5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. | John 9:6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, | John 9:7 And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. | John 9:8 The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? | John 9:9 Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. | John 9:10 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? | John 9:11 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. | John 9:12 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. | John 9:13 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. | John 9:14 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. | John 9:15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. | John 9:16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. | John 9:17 They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. | John 9:18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. | John 9:19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? | John 9:20 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: | John 9:21 But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. | John 9:22 These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. | John 9:23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. | John 9:24 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. | John 9:25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. | John 9:26 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? | John 9:27 He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? | John 9:28 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. | John 9:29 We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. | John 9:30 The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. | John 9:31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. | John 9:32 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. | John 9:33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. | John 9:34 They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. | John 9:35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? | John 9:36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? | John 9:37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. | John 9:38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. | John 9:39 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. | John 9:40 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? | John 9:41 Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.|
              John 10:1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. | John 10:2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. | John 10:3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. | John 10:4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. | John 10:5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. | John 10:6 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. | John 10:7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. | John 10:8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. | John 10:9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. | John 10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. | John 10:11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. | John 10:12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. | John 10:13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. | John 10:14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. | John 10:15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. | John 10:16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. | John 10:17 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. | John 10:18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. | John 10:19 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. | John 10:20 And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? | John 10:21 Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? | John 10:22 And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. | John 10:23 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. | John 10:24 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. | John 10:25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. | John 10:26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. | John 10:27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: | John 10:28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. | John 10:29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. | John 10:30 I and my Father are one. | John 10:31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. | John 10:32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? | John 10:33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. | John 10:34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? | John 10:35 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; | John 10:36 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? | John 10:37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. | John 10:38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him. | John 10:39 Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, | John 10:40 And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. | John 10:41 And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. | John 10:42 And many believed on him there.|
              John 11:1 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. | John 11:2 (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) | John 11:3 Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. | John 11:4 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. | John 11:5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. | John 11:6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. | John 11:7 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. | John 11:8 His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? | John 11:9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. | John 11:10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. | John 11:11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. | John 11:12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. | John 11:13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. | John 11:14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. | John 11:15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. | John 11:16 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. | John 11:17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. | John 11:18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: | John 11:19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. | John 11:20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. | John 11:21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. | John 11:22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. | John 11:23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. | John 11:24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. | John 11:25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: | John 11:26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? | John 11:27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. | John 11:28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. | John 11:29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. | John 11:30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. | John 11:31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. | John 11:32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. | John 11:33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, | John 11:34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see. | John 11:35 Jesus wept. | John 11:36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! | John 11:37 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? | John 11:38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. | John 11:39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. | John 11:40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? | John 11:41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. | John 11:42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. | John 11:43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. | John 11:44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. | John 11:45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. | John 11:46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. | John 11:47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. | John 11:48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. | John 11:49 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, | John 11:50 Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. | John 11:51 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; | John 11:52 And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. | John 11:53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death. | John 11:54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. | John 11:55 And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. | John 11:56 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? | John 11:57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.|
